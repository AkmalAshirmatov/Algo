# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
I have participated in competitive programming olympiads for about 8 years. During this time I succeeded to be 3 times champion of Uzbekistan, placed 4th and 5th places in Central Asia, won several local competitions from Akfa University, TUIT and IT-Park. Last year I won Republic olympiad in informatics. And several times I won prizes in competitions from Google and Facebook. 

In the meantime, I learned new algorithms and added them to my library. Here are most of the algorithms that I needed during the competition.
